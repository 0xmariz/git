git add file_name - this will make the file ready to stage - unstage
git commit - the files will get staged - stage 
git push - this will push into the cloud repo - remote repo

git reset - it is used to edit the staged files. after the staged process if you want to edit the files we have the give git reset.

git commit -m ""


feat - new feature
fix - fix the issue 
!fix - if it affects other users
refactor - editiing the existing one
doc - documentation
chore - not so important work is done

git commit -m "feat : added the Conventional Commits"
git push origin main
origin :initial cloned url

git pull - the will pull from the cloud repo to local.

git status - this will show wheather the file is staged or not 

git diff - this will show the edited area in the file.

git branch - this will tell your current branch

git checkout -B - to create a new branch

git checkout -B "frontend"

to go back to main branch - git checkout main

to push in the frontend branch - git push origin frontend

after pushing it into the frontend branch we need to merge the branch.
for that we need to create a pull request for the admin 
the admin will accept the request and merge into main branch.

now merge conflict - in this the if you edit in local repo and someone edit in cloud repo and
when we want to push our code we will get the merge conflict
so either we have to accept the changes by both changes
